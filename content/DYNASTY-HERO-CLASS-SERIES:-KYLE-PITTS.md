PROSECUTION
Kyle Pitts served as a reserve tight end for Florida his freshman year, playing in 11 out of 14 games as part of their special teams unit, and made it into the boxscore in 3 different games as a tight end. Florida did not have any TE’s of note on their roster in 2018, leading me to speculate on the reasons why he wasn’t more involved. (For example, fellow rookie TE Pat Freiermuth recorded at least one reception in 12 out of 13 games as a freshman for Penn State, and scored 8 touchdowns.) My thoughts include his young age, his lack of blocking prowess, and possibly an unmastered playbook.

He missed two games in his final (junior) season after receiving an illegal cheap shot (targeting-ejection) that led to a concussion and needed minor facial surgery for a broken nose. He returned and played in two games, before missing yet another (the Gators final home game of the season vs. LSU) due to a “lingering injury” suffered vs. Tennessee. Pitts returned to play in their SEC Championship loss to Alabama, and then opted out prior to the Cotton Bowl.

Pitts struggled fighting through crowds and gaining separation when lined up tight to the line as a classic tight end. Even after three years as a Gator, his poor pass blocking and run blocking showed no real improvement. This could lead to his leaving the field in the NFL being a “tell” for the opposing defense that the likelihood of a rushing play just increased.

How much of his success was system based or scheme? How often was Pitts lined up against a college team’s backup slot corner when he scored? How often did he face off against someone with the talent to be drafted to the NFL?

Let’s dig a little.

I went and watched every touchdown and looked up each player Pitts scored on in 2020 and 10 of his 12 touchdowns came against players either undrafted (9) or “Day 3” (one late 6th rounder). He scored on two “Day 2” players: late 2nd round cornerback Tyson Campbell (Georgia) and mid-2nd round cornerback Kelvin Joseph (Kentucky).

Florida QB Kyle Trask broke the SEC record for most touchdown passes through the first seven games of a season with 31 TD. In their first game without Pitts (out-concussion), Florida didn’t miss a beat, scoring the most they’d score all season, with 63 points. In that win, the backup TE went for 3 receptions, 47 yards (15.7) and 2 touchdowns. In the following game with Pitts still sidelined, a DIFFERENT backup TE went for 3 receptions, 66 yards (22.0) and 2 touchdowns. For some context, in his three year career, Kyle Pitts had a total of four games (out of 24) scoring at least two touchdowns.

For those arguing his raw size, athleticism and stats, lets compare him to one of his fellow rookie tight ends that you could grab at the very end of your draft or off of the waiver wire…

TE Kyle Pitts (ATL): 6’5”, 245 lbs., 40-yard dash (4.44) Vertical Jump (33.5”) Broad Jump (129”) Short Shuttle (4.30) 3-Cone Drill (7.12) 225 lb. Bench Press (22 reps), 17.9 yards per reception and a touchdown every 3.58 receptions. (43 rec/770 yards/12 TD)

TE Jacob Harris (LAR): 6’5”, 219 lbs., 40-yard dash (4.39) Vertical Jump (40.5”) Broad Jump (133”) Short Shuttle (4.28) 3-Cone Drill (6.51) 225 lb. Bench Press (15 reps), 18.0 yards per reception and a touchdown every 3.75 receptions. (30 rec/539 yards/8 TD)

(Psst…go get Jacob Harris. He sets BIG goals for his NFL career and that’s a nice mindset to bet on, especially when he’s basically free.)

Listening to Pitts interview, I get the sense the speed of the NFL surprised him a bit, and getting deep into the playbook seemed like a very high priority for him, as it is with most all rookies.

These are classic phrases that have been tried and true heuristics in fantasy football:

1. True tight ends have to know the playbook as well as anyone outside of the quarterback. The learning curve is real. Success comes slowly but surely.

2. The step up in talent from the NCAA to the NFL is a giant step. Only the best of the best make it, and they hold down their jobs against an entire class of rookies trying to take it from them year after year after year. The speed, savvy and wisdom of starting NFL defensive players takes a while to figure out.

Patience will be needed.

DEFENSE
For a “tight end” Kyle Pitts was the ultra-rare treat to watch highlights of. I can count on one hand the number of TE’s I’ve watched over the past 30 years who had highlights that kept me from wanting to doze off.

Similar to his highlights, Pitts’ 2020 season had the statistics that popped off the page and slapped you in the face.

He moves very well in space with excellent body control, has the stickiest of hands, and won’t be legal to drink until we have our Halloween decorations all set up and blinking.

His draft capital is record breaking, and the team-fit couldn’t get much better. Atlanta has a storied history with elite tight end usage, and the exodus of Julio Jones along with not replacing QB Matt Ryan has everything set up for Pitts to thrive.

Upside: when talent and opportunity collide!

VERDICT
I’ve been playing fantasy football since the early 1990’s and have seen the hype grow around players over and over again, only to watch them flop.

One thing worries me big time: EVERYONE AGREES that Kyle Pitts is a sure fire 100% LOCK to be the next big thing.

As a gambler, that sends shivers down my spine.

I have my doubts his blocking becomes a strength, and that creates the possibility of not being on the field as often as possible.

I’m not completely sold on his drive to be the best tight end he can be, as receiving is only a part of that position, and being an oversized or glorified wide receiver playing the tight end position has limiting drawbacks.

I’m not convinced, as many respected colleagues are, that he will dominate as a rookie.

I think his fantasy ceiling in year one could be amazing, but it is somewhat cancelled out by his floor being a potentially horrible one. I think even if he has a “great” rookie season, his stats will not separate nearly enough from the next 8-to-10 tight ends being drafted up to SEVEN ROUNDS after him, if at all.

I respect the learning curve, especially for tight ends.

That said, this is mainly a dynasty leaning website, and the long view of Kyle Pitts is outstanding!

After his 5th year option has been completed, he’ll still be a 25 year old tight end with five years of NFL experience and growth under his belt, and 5+ more years to dominate while at his peak.

The advantage of having one of the elite tight ends in fantasy has proven to be quite a profitable one.

Somehow he has already been coronated KING TIGHT END for dynasty fantasy football without having played a snap. When others are paying the iron price for what a player could become, I prefer to sell high or else smile and accept the proven star wide receiver who just fell into my lap.

I’ll be fading him early on at my own risk, but likely trying to buy low after a typical slow start, or paying through the teeth in trade if he turns out to be what we all hope he can be.

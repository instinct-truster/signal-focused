![Wrapping 6 and 7](/images/default-placeholder.jpeg)

Happy May Day! In my personal breakdown of the year, we have Football Season that dominates most of August through February, followed by Yuck Season running post-Superbowl through April, (The Combine and NFL Draft are highlights of Yuck Season), and Vacation Season covering May through July and into August where the weather is perfect for travel, swimming pools have all opened and school is out. This is when I must schedule enough relaxation and fun with the family to offset my eventual slide into focused hibernation as I make all needed preparations for the return of the King, Football Season.

With the final two rounds to breakdown, I'll slip on my Seven Dwarfs cap and start whistling as I try to uncover one last gem or more hidden deep in this 2018 NFL Draft.

6.01 WR Damion Ratley - CLE

Ratley went all Will Fuller hot to close out his college career, scoring six touchdowns in his final five games. Looks like a speculation deep threat pick for Cleveland, but for dynasty we know those types are a dime a dozen and you can scoop with both hands into the waiver wire pool any time you want and be able to pull out so many they will be dropping through your fingers.

6.02 RB John Kelly - LAR

Some in the dynasty community were high on Kelly. Count me out. His Jekyll and Hyde season started well, but over his final eight games, his per carry average was a pathetic 3.22 ypc. Maybe they see him as a receiving type back? Zero touchdowns receiving. The only players who decide to skip running the 40 yard dash at the combine are??? You guessed it. Slow. As the Diaz Brothers might say, "Don't be scared, homey."

6.11 WR Deon Cane - IND

I believe my man Lance (solid first name) ;-) Zierlein had Deon ranked WR2 on his initial rankings, causing me to dig deeper to see what I was missing. I kept coming up empty. Judging by his slide, I'm thinking my gut was correct. Solid landing spot to prove me wrong, but my plan in upcoming rookie drafts is to let Cane walk the Earth.

6.13 WR Ray-Ray McCloud - BUF

Looks to me like a potential special teams return man.

6.17 WR Dylan Cantrell - LAC

With jumps that would make Wesley Snipes do a double take (38.5" vert, 130" broad) Cantrell put himself on my radar. At 6'3", 226 lbs, he's bigger, faster, and performed every single combine event better than last year's darling Cooper Kupp, who pushed for fantasy WR ROY honors. His stats point to more workout warrior than hidden gem, though, so he'll be a speculation pick you can get on the cheap late in rookie drafts.

6.20 WR Russell Gage - ATL

Atlanta adds a potential high energy special teams contributor here.

6.25 QB Luke Falk - TEN

Tennessee adds someone to compete with Blaine Gabbert to back up Mariota. (Check out the video of Marcus with his crazy offensive linemen enjoying a wild hockey celebration complete with pouring beer from the mouth of a big ass fish. ðŸ—©)

6.27 RB Boston Scott - NOR

The Saints add the dual threat Baton Rouge native for some RB speculation depth. His stats at Louisiana Tech were pretty nice, as well as his Pro Day. (4.4 40ydash, 38.5 vert) His special teams return experience may help him stick.

6.29 QB Tanner Lee - JAC

Just adding a camp body here whose turnover rate makes Bortles look good.

6.30 RB Trenton Cannon - NYJ

GEM ALERT! Cannon landed in a spot where there is a glimmer of hope for him as a thin (185 lbs) change of pace back. His dual threat small-school numbers were solid, combining for 136.5 yards per game and 11 TD as a sophomore, 128.8 yards per game and 20 TD as a junior, and 169.3 yards per game with 21 TD as a senior. Big time discount on those stats based on weak opponents, but his testing turned out to be impressive as well, with a 4.40 40ydash, 38.5" vert and 129" broad. There may be a role to carve out aside from special teams here.

6.33 WR Equanimeous St. Brown - GB

Autumnal fell like that last leaf in A Bug's Life. Many had him in their top 10 or better WR rookie rankings. Not I. Green Bay is mashing the pedal on later round larger sized wide receivers this draft. He looks like just another deep threat to me. Never say never with size-speed guys, but I don't see anything that will separate him from the many other NFL caliber roster fillers. If there is any lesson to be learned from this year, it is that acting entitled is a great way to drop your draft stock.

6.34 WR Cedrick Wilson - DAL

GEM ALERT! Hit all the needed combine marks and paired them with solid college production. Character gets a plus rating. Had B2B 1100+ yards seasons, with five 100+ yard games in 2016 to go with 11 TD, and six 100+ yard games (with two 200+ yard games) in 2017. Closed strong over his final month for Boise St. putting up 5 receptions for 107 yards, 7 for 134, 8 for 148, and (continuing the trend of getting better each game) went 10 rec for 221 yards and a TD in their Las Vegas Bowl win over Oregon. Landed in the WR sweet spot to compete with the rest of the gang in Dallas, and despite his late round draft status I give him a decent shot.

6.36 WR Braxton Berrios - NE

Being comped to Amendola and then becoming his potential replacement has dynasty folks all lathered up. Count me out. I respect his short area game and toughness to score, but I'm looking for difference makers and leave even proven guys like Adam Humphries on the waiver wire for others to enjoy.

6.37 TE Jordan Thomas - HOU

Potential camp body whose only standout metric to me was his huge 11 5/8" mitts.

7.01 QB Danny Etling - NE

You know when you watch training camp and the line of quarterbacks all hike and roll back at the same time? He's one of those guys.

7.02 QB Alex McGough - SEA

Ditto of the above statement. When you want to draft a true backup QB, you don't pick them from the 7th round scrap pile.

7.06 WR Javon Wims - CHI

ANY wide receiver the Bears pick needs close scrutiny and Wims isn't so bad. Led the National Champion runner up Bulldogs in receiving, but when you factor in the NFL-esque 15 game season they went through, the number are lacking. Has decent size-speed-hands catching skills, so he has a punchers chance of sticking through cuts.

7.08 RB David Williams - DEN

Transferred to Arkansas as a senior and managed to just barely lead them in rushing in a split-duty role. Had a light load for someone his size (229 lbs) yet managed to score 10 TD. Landing in DEN he did enough to at least keep an eye out to see if his name starts popping up in camp.

7.10 WR Marcell Ateman - OAK

As my pre-draft rookie WR9, seeing him drop so far scuffed much of the shine off. Measuring taller than listed (6'5") his age and sub-par combine must have done him in. Landing in Oakland shouldn't hurt, but there's no room for him at the moment. His three 2-TD games and going for 100 yards receiving or more in seven of his last eleven isn't chicken scratch. Martavis Bryant should have little trouble holding him off.

7.18 RB Bo Scarbrough - DAL

Had big name hype at one point, but it didn't last long after Damien Harris took over. Peppered in as just another weapon for Alabama, his lack of receiving chops and being blocked by one of the best in the league makes injury his only potential path for dynasty. Dallas is light on the handcuff options behind Zeke, so if you are into cuffing low upside guys, at least the DAL OL could make him look alright.

7.19 RB Nick Bawden - DET

Nice lead blocking fullback for the new regime in DET. Was a factor in creating holes for both Donnel Pumphrey and Rashaad Penny's league leading rushing seasons. DET looks to become more smash mouth, and Bawden could be huge for Kerryon Johnson's success.

7.22 WR Richie James - SF

GEM ALERT! A guy who just missed my top 10 WR list, "I'm Richie James, Bit@#!" makes up for the 49ers missing so badly over-drafting Pettis much earlier. His small size took it's toll with an injury shortened season in 2017, but his body of work is incredible, dropping nice games on all opponents. He's a guy I'll be trying to add to every one of my dynasty leagues.

7.31 QB Logan Woodside - CIN

Again, being the seventh round I will not be expecting much, but 45 passing TD's with only 9 INT in 2016 should be note worthy enough to track him. Dalton hasn't been setting the league on fire, and has only one touchdown vs. seven turnovers in his four one-and-done playoff appearances.

7.32 TE Ryan Izzo - NE

The Patriots add a road-grading tight end to rotate in and do the dirty work. Not having to alert defenses that he's eligible at the goal line, he could be the new TD vulturing toy for Belichick & Company.

7.33 RB Justin Jackson - LAC

For a 199 lb. running back, this kid defined GRINDER in his career at Northwestern. His combine was fine, and his four year production was insane, but talk about wear on the tires!!! You could go with "tough as nails" as well, but check out his eight year workload! He reportedly went for over 6500 yards and 85 TD in high school, then follow that up with over 6100 yards and 40 TD in college! Made of Iron! With a resume like that, my money is he will find a way to stick in the NFL on work ethic, soldier mindset and drive alone. Like Rudy, only good.

7.35 WR Auden Tate - CIN

A "why not?" pick this late, his slow combine proved what scouts saw on film. Despite his 6'5", 228 lb. frame, his speed and jumps were just too poor to trust he can make the jump to the NFL.

7.37 WR Austin Proehl - BUF

It helps to be the son of a former NFL player and coach.

7.38 WR Trey Quinn - WAS

GEM ALERT! For being the final player drafted as "Mr. Irrelevant", I'd have to say Quinn is quite relevant. He outperformed (24 FPTS/gm) teammate and early second round pick Courtland Sutton (19 FPTS/gm) and is a tad younger too. The Redskins WR group is so shallow, I could imagine Trey finding his way to not only make the team, but to get involved quite a bit. Bold Prediction: Quinn becomes a starter in Washington by Thanksgiving.

Well there you have it! Like I mentioned to Rotoworld's Evan Silva on twitter, "I've got a new appreciation for the effort it takes to do long write-ups like these." It is no joke to put in the time needed to process a draft breakdown like this. It is mentally and physically draining, but worth every bit of effort to have a timely written opinion with an internet "time-stamp" to look back on and see if I am correct more often than I am wrong. I consider myself lucky to have the honor of a multi-year ongoing email string with one of the best and most dynasty knowledgeable people I know of in Michael Cobb (menobrown), and his insights and critiques could double the length of these articles. We have a novel worth of player and team talk in extra-long back and forths stringing back years now, but I can't point to a private email and claim anything, so writing and staking my claims in the public space will now give me that option.

I hope you have enjoyed this series breaking down the 2018 NFL Draft from a dynasty perspective. Now that we have out-lasted the dreg months of dead news cycles, things are looking up! So much more to write about including putting together my Post-Draft Dynasty Rookie Rankings! Be on the lookout for more articles to come as I slowly build up my writing endurance.

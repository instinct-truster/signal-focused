PROSECUTION

Gets a small dynasty ding for returning to college for his senior season, reducing the likely amount of peak years in the NFL by one.

Unable to test at Alabama Pro Days due to lingering ankle injury.

Heavy workload to date, averaging more than 22 carries per game over his final three seasons of high school, and over 20 touches per game over his final two seasons of college.

DEFENSE

Excellent size and one of very few (RB, WR, TE) recruits to receive a 5-Star rating from all three of the sites I track.

Dominated his peers in high school, averaging almost 2600 yards rushing and 31 touchdowns per season over his final three years.

Grew up in a difficult and rough environment, moving frequently and sometimes sharing a small apartment with up to 13 people. Has a strong and healthy mindset that looks back on the hard times with appreciation and a smile.

The opposite of a Diva, Najee’s professional approach shows throughout his well rounded game. Great soldier-like work ethic with the perfect match being drafted by the Steelers. Even as a rookie, his workload should be elite.

Has marketed his personal brand with a golden silhouette of his likeness at the peak of his famous hurdle move.

Saved his best for last, leading Alabama to a perfect season and National Championship, while setting Crimson Tide records for career rushing yards, scrimmage yards and touchdowns.

Going back for his senior year in retrospect was the smart move, avoiding a stacked 2020 RB class which saw only one RB selected in the first round. His improvements across the board led to Harris being selected in the first round of the 2021 class, and he joined the elusive and prestigious 30 POINTS CLUB, by averaging more than 30 fantasy points per game in his final season at Alabama.

VERDICT

I’ve been watching NFL football since the late 1970’s and still have a neutral stance on the chicken vs. egg debate regarding what makes players eventually break down, age or wear and tear on the body from high volume. I haven’t been convinced one way or the other yet, so when I see a player has both the body type and will power to take on a heavy workload year after year, I buy in. Durability is in the running for the most important trait in our game.

Najee is one of the safest bets to succeed both immediately and consistently in his draft class.

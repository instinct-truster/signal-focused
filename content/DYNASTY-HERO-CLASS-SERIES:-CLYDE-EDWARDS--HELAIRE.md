PROSECUTION

As a sophomore at LSU, Clyde played second fiddle to a fairly no-named senior RB.

Only one season of dominance in college.

Late in his rookie season, he missed one game with the flu, then suffered a fairly serious injury Week 15 when bent backward into the splits position during a tackle. He missed the final two games of the regular season as well as the first round of the playoffs. Kansas City very cautiously eased him back into playing time, limiting him to only 7 touches in the AFC Championship game, and 11 touches in the Super Bowl.

DEFENSE

Love both the head and chip on his shoulders.

Hand selected by quarterback Patrick Mahomes when asked (by Chiefs General Manager Brett Veach) which of the amazing 2019 rookie running back class would he like to play with most. Coach Andy Reid affectionately called Clyde “My Little Guy.”

Despite playing with a bunch of future NFL stars, Joe Burrow stated Clyde was "no question" the best athlete on LSU's team.

He’s had his share of life’s challenges, from being inspired by the strength of his younger sister with Muscular Dystrophy to having the unfortunate circumstance that ended in a self-defense fatal shooting incident during an attempted robbery of he and his friend while in college. His strong family bond has helped keep him positive, resilient and humble.

When the #1 ranked (8-0 LSU) and #2 ranked (8-0 Alabama) college football teams faced off in 2019, it was an absolutely star-studded event worthy of rewatching. Joe Burrow (3 TD) vs. Tua Tagovailoa (4 TD), with touchdowns scored by WR’s Jerry Jeudy, Ja’Marr Chase, Jaylen Waddle and Terrace Marshall. RB Najee Harris and WR DeVonta Smith each scored twice as well, but the star of the show was Clyde Edwards-Helaire with his 4 total touchdowns, leading LSU to 5-point victory on their way to an undefeated National Championship season.

VERDICT

Although the finish to his rookie season left a poor taste in our mouths, there is plenty to like heading into 2021.

Through Week 11 of last year, Clyde was ranked #1 in both total fantasy points as well as fantasy points per game among the consensus top rookie running backs (Taylor, Swift, Dobbins, Akers and Gibson).

From listening to him speak about his rookie season in interviews, it sounded like he was a bit overwhelmed in general and may have needed more time to fully absorb the Chiefs complex playbook.

I’m expecting a bump in volume and production, as historically Coach Reid has used that second season to fully unleash his young running backs.

With a balanced skill set for scoring fantasy points via rushing, receiving or touchdowns, Clyde’s overall floor and ceiling are elite moving forward.

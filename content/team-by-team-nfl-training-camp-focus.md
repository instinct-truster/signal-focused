With Training Camp in full gear, Summer has effectively been terminated for those with the dream of playing for the NFL in 2018.

For me, not so much, as I'm booked for a Staycation with the family this very weekend at California's Great America and am currently organizing a Bro's Weekend in Vegas at Planet Hollywood for the 11th annual Fantasy Football Players Championship's Kickoff Weekend!

If you love Fantasy Football, there is no place you'd rather be than in sunny Las Vegas when the stats start to count! Check it off your Bucket List as soon as you can afford to do so. You will not regret it. Very similar to what was said in the movie Dazed and Confused, but much less creepy dealing with 21 year olds... "That's what I love about these Vegas girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age."

I'd like to comment and voice some questions I have for every team as they head into camp. Shed some light on what I'll be focusing on for each NFL team as the news cycle gets ramped up to full blast with what we've been craving for weeks and weeks: actual daily coverage of the National Football League!

FOOTBALL IS BACK, BABY!!!

ARIZONA CARDINALS

---

I'm fully satisfied with the health of David Johnson's wrist after watching him perform 105 lb. rotating single arm incline dumbbell presses on his twitter feed. Yup. I'm good.

The new moving parts in Arizona all pique my interest as the team transitions toward youth on offense. Will WR Christian Kirk lock down the WR2 role right away? Will RB Chase Edmonds establish himself as the handcuff to own for DJ? Is WR Chad Williams someone worth rostering for fantasy speculation or just a mirage?

Will Sam Bradford hold off Josh Rosen and string together a full season of health? He's quietly managed almost 2.5 touchdowns for every interception (56 TD, 23 INT) over his past four injury plagued seasons.

Health...it's what's for dinner.

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Christian Kirk.

ATLANTA FALCONS

---

It seems like more people talked about the meaningless non-scoring sideline drop by the Browns WR Corey Coleman than Julio's game winning drop vs. the eventual Superbowl Champions in the Divisional round of the playoffs last year. That said, I think "Stud" translated into Spanish is Julio. "Pyay that myan his myoney."

I'll be interested in seeing if WR Calvin Ridley is anything more than a typical NFL wide receiver. I wonder if OC Steve Sarkisian has what it takes to get more out of the Falcons than he did in his first go-round. I have my doubts.

Being born in the same city as Tom Brady and yours truly isn't enough to cancel out the lack of usage to date for recently hyped TE Austin Hooper. He showed nothing in the playoffs last year and should inspire no confidence based on pure wordcraft.

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Calvin Ridley.

![Camp](/images/camp-5.png)

BALTIMORE RAVENS

---

Same stale team, or juicy youth movement? Mallett backing up Flacco, or RG3 backing up Lamar Jackson? You know what to do Coach!

This team has diamonds all over the place to mine. Will RB Kenneth Dixon finally produce, or can we all just cut him? Will my man Jordan Lasley show the world that he's better than Calvin Ridley? Will Crabtree run away with the WR1 role?

Which rookie TE (if any) will rise to the top? The entire Raven WR corps has been upgraded talent-wise for whomever lines up under center.

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Lamar Jackson.

![Camp](/images/camp-6.png)

BUFFALO BILLS

---

Can LeSean McCoy be punished for hearsay? Will Josh Allen outshine the two chumps ahead of him, or will he join them like the Three Stooges?

Is TE Charles Clay really someone you want to trust in fantasy? Will WR Kelvin Benjamin get enough consistent targets to matter? Does WR Zay Jones have a future in the NFL? The Shadow knows.

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: LeSean McCoy.

![Camp](/images/camp-7.png)

CAROLINA PANTHERS

---

Ahhh, back to a team with some talent. Writing about Buffalo was ugly.

Will Riverboat Ron push his chips to the middle of the table for Christian McCaffrey? Might OC Norv Turner use McCaffrey like (5'10" 215 lbs) Ladanian Tomlinson?

Will D.J. Moore become the Panther's WR1 during Training Camp? Is he already?

As a team, are these the best weapons Cam Newton has had to throw to?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Christian McCaffrey.

![Camp](/images/camp-8.png)

CHICAGO BEARS

---

How much more action will Tarik Cohen earn? Will Coach Nagy try to make Jordan Howard a three down back?

Can both Allen Robinson and rookie WR Anthony Miller become stars in Chicago? Is Mitch Trubisky a future Pro-Bowler?

Does TE Trey Burton live up to his fairly expensive draft day investment? Will WR Kevin White remain in the NFL for a second contract?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Allen Robinson.

![Camp](/images/camp-9.png)

CINCINNATI BENGALS

---

Who shuts up first, the Joe Mixon Lovers or the Joe Mixon Haters?

Will the Bengals smash the injury bug with their boot, or will it hide in the ladder cradle and sting once more?

Is Andy Dalton good enough to make one of their non-A.J. Green wide receivers startable? Will John Ross show that he wasn't just a Combine Warrior? Can RB Mark Walton scratch out a role?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Joe Mixon.

![Camp](/images/camp-10.png)

CLEVELAND BROWNS

---

Can Tyrod Taylor hold off Baker Mayfield for long?

Will the Browns ever give Duke Johnson a shot at a real workload? Does Nick Chubb make a splash, or will Carlos Hyde keep him warming bench? Does Jarvis Landry turn into a pumpkin until Mayfield takes over?

Will Josh Gordon return in a week and carry on like nothing happened, or will it become two weeks...three weeks, and get his dynasty investors palms a sweating?

Will Corey Coleman or Antonio Callaway emerge? How about Njoku? Tyrod has shown some love to his TE. Can Tyrod lean on more than one target? How about even ONE target? (He's never targeted a player 100 times in his career)

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Josh Gordon.

![Camp](/images/camp-11.png)

DALLAS COWBOYS

---

Can WR Michael Gallup flash enough in Training Camp to threaten for WR1 role? Is Allen Hurns really a WR1?

Will Ezekiel Elliott rush for 2K? Will the Cowboys receiving corps pose enough of a threat to keep defenses honest? Can WR Cedrick Wilson carve out his place on the roster?

Will Cole Beasley make David Dodds eat his words?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Michael Gallup.

![Camp](/images/camp-12.png)

DENVER BRONCOS

---

Is Case Keenum as good as his career 86 Quarterback Rating, or is he a flash in the pan that just got paid by the franchise who enjoys overpaying flash in the pans?

Will RB Royce Freeman break the Curse of Oregon RB's? Can Booker make him carry his pads?

Who will become the new fantasy tight end star in Denver, Jake Butt or rookie Troy Fumagalli? (or neither?)

Can rookie WR Courtland Sutton buck the odds and force his way onto the field?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Jake Butt.

![Camp](/images/camp-13.png)

DETROIT LIONS

---

Can Coach Patricia bring some winning culture to Detroit?

Will rookie RB Kerryon Johnson snatch a large role from the get-go?

Can WR Kenny Golladay challenge for a large piece of the gameday pie? Can QB Matt Stafford get back to the days when he toyed with 5K yards passing?

Is TE Luke Wilson talented enough to make a little fantasy noise in Detroit?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Kenny Golladay.

![Camp](/images/camp-14.png)

GREEN BAY PACKERS

---

Can WR Danvante Adams take another step up the WR rankings with a full season of Aaron Rodgers feeding him? Is WR Randall Cobb being severely under-drafted?

Will TE Jimmy Graham revive his career in Green Bay? Do the rookie WR's pan out as anything more than just role players?

Can RB Aaron Jones become a star for the Pack?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Aaron Jones.

![Camp](/images/camp-15.png)

HOUSTON TEXANS

---

What will QB DeShaun Watson do for an encore? Can he even sniff last year's efficiency?

Can rookie WR Keke Coutee push for the WR3 role right away? How about WR2? Can WR Will Fuller hold him back?

Will RB D'Onta Foreman show how far surgery has advanced, or will he be yet another victim of the speed-sapping Achilles tear? Does RB Lamar Miller continue to fade even with the gifted workload?

Can J.J. Watt's return elevate the Texans defense into the top 10?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Keke Coutee.

![Camp](/images/camp-16.png)

INDIANAPOLIS COLTS

---

Can QB Andrew Luck reprogram his muscle memory in time to make a return to dominance at his position?

Does TE Eric Ebron become his new short range safety blanket? Can Doyle and Swope assist the lacking WR corps?

Will rookie WR's Deon Cain or Reece Fountain make some noise, or will the vets keep their roles locked down?

Can RB Marlon Mack become The Man in their stable of RB's? Will rookie RBs Nyheim Hines and Jordan Wilkins have their say in the matter?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Marlon Mack.

![Camp](/images/camp-17.png)

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS

---

What to make of their WR depth chart? Will it be Lee, Moncrief, Dede or Cole at the top?

Does TE Austin Seferian-Jenkins make much of a fantasy impact in Jacksonville? Can QB Blake Bortles support a few targets like back when the Jaguar defense sucked, or are those days long gone, and it's the Leonard Fournette Show now?

Can the Jags DEF go Back-to-Back as the top fantasy defense?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Donte Moncrief.

![Camp](/images/camp-18.png)

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS

---

Can Patrick Mahomes possibly live up to the hype? (I sure hope so!)

Will WR Sammy Watkins alpha the WR1 role from Tyreek Hill?

Will the return of RB Spencer Ware have any effect whatsoever on Kareem Hunts workload? I recall last year rubbing my eyes when I saw the Chiefs sub in Charcandrick West to rob Hunt of like four touchdowns.

With TE friendly Alex Smith gone, can Travis Kelce even sniff his 120 targets or so from the last two years?

Will drafting all (6 out of 6) defensive players in the NFL Draft impact their defense positively?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Sammy Watkins.

![Camp](/images/camp-19.jpeg)

LOS ANGELES CHARGERS

---

Can someone besides Keenan Allen impose their will on the Chargers passing game?

Will they sign TE Antonio Gates, or someone else? Can one of the big Williams Boys help out in the redzone after losing Hunter Henry?

Can RB Melvin Gordon retain such a large load as a receiver? Can RB Justin Jackson make a little noise?

Who will QB Phillip Rivers turn into a star next?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Mike Williams.

![Camp](/images/camp-20.png)

LOS ANGELES RAMS

---

If their defense becomes Jaguarian, how will that impact their aggression in play calling and need for scoring? Can they remain as efficient as they were in 2017?

Has Brandin Cooks finally found his long term home? Will he take a step up the WR rankings as their new WR1?

Can RB Todd Gurley possibly repeat his magical season last year?

Will either of their tight ends Everett or Higbee get more involved?

Has WR Cooper Kupp already peaked, or does he have another level he can get to? Will Robert Woods turn back into Robert Woods?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Brandin Cooks.

![Camp](/images/camp-21.png)

MIAMI DOLPHINS

---

Are we all sleeping on the Dolphins fantasy-wise? Can QB Ryan Tannehill be a serviceable streamer?

Is WR DeVante Parker about to explode right when we all gave up on him?

Can Albert Wilson build on a solid 2017? Will he and Danny Amendola hurt Kenny Stills value much?

Can anyone make RB Frank Gore a teams RB2, or will he Silverback Alpha the RB1 role in Miami like he has to all comers his entire career? A return to his home area (Born and raised in Miami, Miami Hurricane) may rejuvenate him. Will rookie RB Kalen Ballage make a little training camp noise?

Does TE Mike Gesicki have the talent to make an instant fantasy impact, or will he take the slow train to Starterville as most tight ends do?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: DeVante Parker.

![Camp](/images/camp-22.png)

MINNESOTA VIKINGS

---

Who will QB Kirk Cousins develop chemistry with?

Will RB Dalvin Cook look the same as he did last year? Can he become a top five fantasy player?

How will a new offensive coordinator impact their success?

Will WR Adam Thielen ever match his Antonio Brown-like 142 targets from last season, and who's going to get that treatment now that Case is in Denver? Is Stefon Diggs the man to invest in going forward?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Dalvin Cook.

![Camp](/images/camp-23.png)

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS

---

Are we looking at another clusterfuck of a season for picking which RB to start week-to-week in New England? Can rookie Sony Michel earn a heavy load, or will Rex Burkhead have something to say about it? Is James White still rotating in on passing downs? Will Jeremy Hill rotate in at the goal-line?

Will QB Tom Brady continue to stiff-arm Father Time or is Duck Season right around the corner?

Can WR Jordan Matthews revive his career? Can Chris Hogan stay healthy for an entire season? Will Julian Edelman get back to where he left off?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Sony Michel.

![Camp](/images/camp-24.png)

NEW ORLEANS SAINTS

---

Can TE Ben Watson keep the fires burning at age 38? Can QB Drew Brees at 39? Will a touchdown by those two break some sort of combined age record?

Will RB Alvin Kamara continue to match his elite efficiency? Can Terrance West ease the pain of losing Mark Ingram to suspension? How will Shane Vereen factor in?

Is Cameron Meredith severely undervalued? Will rookie WR Tre'quan Smith flash in training camp and leap frog the depth chart?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Cameron Meredith.

![Camp](/images/camp-25.png)

NEW YORK GIANTS

---

Can RB Saquon Barkley be as good as advertised?

Is TE Evan Engram a more talented weapon than any Giants wide receiver not named Odell Beckham? If so, can he retain more of a target load than most are taking away from him? Is Sterling Shepard really worthy of being an NFL team's WR2?

When Beckham was overall WR4 in 2016 and QB Eli Manning was overall QB21 that same year, why do folks think he'll become any better this year at the age of 37?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Saquon Barkley.

![Camp](/images/camp-26.png)

NEW YORK JETS

---

I know he's young and many folks like him, but how good is rookie QB Sam Darnold really? He has a built-in excuse for failure when looking over that roster, but I'll be watching him closely.

Can rookie RB Trenton Cannon carve out a nice role for himself in that motley crew of Jet running backs?

Will the NFL slap a suspension on WR Robby Anderson? Who will emerge from a group of cast-off wide receivers?

Can rookie TE Chris Herndon add to the lore of "Tight End U"?

Sure, they will make for excellent bottom-barrel priced DFS dart throws, but will any Jet be a reliable starter in seasonal fantasy football outside of BYE weeks or desperation?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Sam Darnold.

![Camp](/images/camp-27.png)

OAKLAND RAIDERS

---

How will Coach Gruden adapt to the current NFL? Who will he lean on at running back, Marshawn Lynch or Dougie Martin?

Will Amari Cooper have a career year with ball hog Michael Crabtree no longer there? Can Jordy Nelson absorb most of those many lost targets? Will Martavis Bryant avoid suspension and maybe even become a key player in the Raiders offense?

Does Chucky have plans of moving TE Jared Cook all over to create mismatches?

Is Derek Carr a sold NFL QB, and can Coach Gruden amplify his game?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Jordy Nelson.

![Camp](/images/camp-28.png)

PHILADELPHIA EAGLES

---

Can RB Jay Ajayi capture more of a three down role and get closer to the 50 or so receptions he had back at Boise State? Is the 35 year old Darren Sproles still good enough to force the young Eagle running backs to the sidelines on passing downs?

Will QB Carson Wentz be as good for fantasy without the rushing stats? Will he continue to run?

How will the Eagles carve out some room for rookie TE Dallas Goedert? Similar to the Giants and TE Engram, could Goedert be as talented as the Philly wide receivers and get on the field more than many think?

Will there be a post Superbowl letdown?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Dallas Goedert.

![Camp](/images/camp-29.png)

PITTSBURGH STEELERS

---

How well does rookie RB Jaylen Samuels pick up the offense, and in which ways does Pittsburgh mix him in? Will he become the true handcuff to Le'Veon Bell?

Can WR Juju Smith-Schuster build on an outstanding rookie season. Can he maintain such efficiency? How will the talented WR James Washington be used?

Was the uber-usage of TE Vance McDonald in the playoffs a sign of things to come (16 targets in one game) or just a fluky aberration?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: James Washington.

![Camp](/images/camp-30.png)

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS

---

Will rookie RB Rahaad Penny make his doubters heads explode?

Can WR Brandon Marshall actually make the team? If so, how nice of a role will he get? Can Tyler Lockett stay healthy and build on his game?

Just how good does RB Chris Carson look? Will we ever get to see a healthy C.J. Prosise perform again?

Are rookie TE Will Dissly's blocking skills as good as advertised? Did the Seahawks do enough to improve their offensive line, or is QB Russell Wilson in for another difficult season?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Rashaad Penny.

![Camp](/images/camp-31.png)

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS

---

Is QB Jimmy Garoppolo the real deal? Can he lose?

Can RB Jerick McKinnon handle a heavy workload and avoid injury? Who looks the best behind him on the depth chart? Will Jeremy McNichols get any camp buzz? How about "Pound the Table" Joe Williams?

How is WR Pierre Garcon looking? Will rookie WR Dante Pettis be much more than a glorified return man? Can Trent Taylor man the slot? Can he be challenged by rookie WR Richie James?

Does TE George Kittle build on the chemistry he started with Garoppolo late last season?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: George Kittle.

![Camp](/images/camp-32.png)

TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS

---

How does rookie RB Ronald Jones look moving around? Does his speed still flash at the next level?

Does QB Jameis Winston and the rest of the team keep their crew's morale up during his absence.

Can the four combined upgrades from the past two draft classes make a positive impact of the Buccaneer's scoring upside? Will rookie WR Justin Watson create some buzz?

Will WR Chris Godwin and TE O.J. Howard earn more and more snaps in 2018? Will they both end up as starters?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Ronald Jones.

![Camp](/images/camp-33.png)

TENNESSEE TITANS

---

What kind of a workload split will RB's Dion Lewis and Derrick Henry wind up with, and will it be reliable week-to-week?

Can WR Corey Davis capture the Alpha role as the Titans WR1 and get the target spoils that go with it? Can WR Taywan Taylor work his way up the depth chart?

If Davis become the focal point of the passing game, how will that effect TE Delanie Walker's workload?

Will QB Marcus Mariota take that next step in 2018 with his improving targets?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Corey Davis.

![Camp](/images/camp-34.png)

WASHINGTON REDSKINS

---

How will rookie RB Derrius Guice be used on passing downs? Will RB Chris Thompson return to his very impressive play before getting injured last season?

Will WR Jamison Crowder continue to get peppered with close to 100 targets per season with Alex Smith?

How will WR Josh Doctson fit in? Could he become their WR1? How does rookie WR Trey Quinn look?

Can TE Jordan Reed become a fantasy force again or will we be closing his book?

Training Camp player I'll be focused on most: Josh Doctson.

---

That's a wrap!

These are the things going through my head as we return to football! Many questions will be answered during training camp, many will not.

I liked the soft-fuzzy metallic matte finish of these alternate replica mini-helmets. Some looked quite nice.

Looking forward to getting my official FFPC Main Event draft slot in the upcoming week! Live in Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada!

If you ever get a chance to do it...DO IT! You will meet tons of cool people and have a blast!

The final few teams start Training Camp tomorrow morning, and we will have wall-to-wall news blowing up your twitter feeds for the next few weeks!

Enjoy it!

FOOTBALL IS BACK!!!

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed!
